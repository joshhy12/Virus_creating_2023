# Virus Creating Project

This project is focused on developing viruses for penetration testing and cybersecurity research purposes. The goal is to create viruses that can be used to test the security of systems and networks, identify vulnerabilities, and improve defensive measures.

## Disclaimer

The viruses created in this project are intended for educational and research purposes only. They should never be used for malicious or illegal activities. The creators of this project are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by the viruses.

## Features

- Develop various types of viruses, including file infectors, boot sector viruses, and macro viruses.
- Implement techniques for virus obfuscation and anti-virus evasion.
- Study the behavior and propagation mechanisms of viruses.
- Analyze the impact of viruses on different operating systems and applications.
- Explore countermeasures and mitigation strategies against virus attacks.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need a secure and isolated environment for testing purposes. It is recommended to use a virtual machine or a dedicated testing system to avoid any potential risks to your production environment.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/joshhy12/virus_creating_2023.git`
2. Set up the development environment according to the instructions in the project documentation.
3. Familiarize yourself with the project structure and the available virus samples.
4. Contribute to the project by developing new viruses, improving existing ones, or enhancing the documentation.
